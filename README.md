# AI Learns to play Flappy Bird

## Introduction

This project is made from scratch, all the libraries used are created by me. The goal of this program is to teach an AI to play Flappy Bird using the Genetic Algorithm.

## Setup

All you have to do is open the ```index.html``` file.

## Usage

This is what it looks like when you open the program.
The Show button shows you what the bird sees, and with the Play button, you can play Flappy Bird while the AI is training in the background. You can always press the Training button to see how far the AI has progressed. You can change the speed at which it moves using this slider.
